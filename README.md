# HuffmanCompression
(c)Yannis Lawrence
A Huffman compression algorithm I built for ECM1414

Note: The python package bitstring is required for the solution to run, use the command: _pip install bitstring_ 

To begin makes sure the file you would like to compress file is within the folder _*/src/res_ and that the encoding of the file is utf-8 and is a .txt file. Once the requirments are met open the file _*/src/Encoder.py_ and then follow the prompts given on screen.
To decode a file, make sure that it is a _.bin_ file that was produced by the encoder and that it is placed in the file _*/src/res_, once again follow the onscreen prompts in the file _*/src/Decoder.py_ entering the correct file name when asked for the input.
